    There's this girl and she wants to carry gold out of a mine, but she can only make one trip since the mine is collapsing. She has an array of up to ~40 chunks of gold that she can take. But since she is human, she can only carry a maximum weight of total gold. Your goal is to maximize the weight of gold that she takes without going over the max Capacity.
    Here are the problem limits (and this is where I get confused af)
    The max weight she can carry is 1e9
    the number of chunks of gold is 42
    and the weight of each chunk of gold is between 1 and 1e9

    This is a knapsack problem where, the weight sequals to the profits. 
    * Branch and bound is useless because it redners the Greedy Heuristic Usless.
