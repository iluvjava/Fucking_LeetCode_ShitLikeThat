## Solution

* The algorithm is greedy.

* It's a direct applications of sorting because we are only maximizing the number of items. 

* The sorted one will give the maximum number of items can buy. 
  * Assuming other wise that, swapping the sorted prices in ascending order gives a better solution. 
  * That is just plain impossible to happen, any way of swapping the elements will increase the total prices, 
  reducing the numbr of items that can be purchased with the budget.
