# Problem statement

* A difference between 2 elements in the array is the differences between any 2 elements that

 are not in the same index.

* We want to look for the minimum aboslute value for the difference for all pairs of the
 integers in the array.

# Idea 1: Sorting

* Sort the element so that, the minimum difference must appear in a pair of elements that are 

adjacent in the sorted array. 

  * Assume that this is not ture, then we have a bit contradiction.
