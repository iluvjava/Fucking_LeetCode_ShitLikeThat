* Enhance Merge Sort as a way of counting inversions
  * The number of inversion is directly related to the number of adjacent swapps
  going from a sorted list to an unsorted list.  
## Set, Map Related

### Anagram
* An anagram of substring is defined to be the substring of a string that are 
permutations of each other. 
* All substring has a unique permutations to it, putting them into a set 
structure will create basis for comparison.

### Frequencies Tables 
* It isare another widely used idea in Set, and Map related 
  coding challenges. 
* Learn how to use them for a set of element involvng repeatitions.

### Prefix Sum
* Accumulating the partial sum for a given 2d or 1d array.
