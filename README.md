# WTF is this repo?

* This is a repo where I put all my solutions (failed or passed) with the procedures of solving them (to some
level of details).

* It's meant to be here, so I can do quick reference to find similar questions when other people asked me about some
kind of coding interview problems, and then I can just solve use this repo to the point to the solution and the
processing of solving the problem.
