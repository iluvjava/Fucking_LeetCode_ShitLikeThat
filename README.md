# WTF is this repo?

* This is a repo where I put all my solutions (failed or passed) with the procedures of solving them (to some
level of details).

* It's meant to be here, so I can do quick reference to find similar questions when other people asked me about some
kind of coding interview problems, and then I can just solve use this repo to the point to the solution and the
processing of solving the problem.

## Table of Contents

* **Leetcode Problems** most of them solved, and with a .md file explaining what approaches to the problem and revealing the idea behind it

* **Hackerrank Problems**  Problems solved by me on Hacerrank.

* **Obsidian Notes**
  * Connects CS/Math relavent ideas to the coding challenges
  * Categorizing, explaing, exploitations with algorithms and datastructure which got applied to the coding challenges.

* **Code Vaults**
  * Implementation of common algorithmic routine for solving coding challenges
  * Implementations of uncommon data structure that doesn't exist in most of the programming languages, but still have usage in competitive coding challenges. 
    * Or just abstracted data structure for solving some particular weird problems.
