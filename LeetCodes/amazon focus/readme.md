# Amzon Focus, Part II, CS Fundementals

* Yes, let's do this.

* Amazon allows for c++, C#, java, and python, I will focus on java 1.8 and python 3.7.

* Amzon allows and recommends that a partially working non-optimal solution for a solution that is trying to be optimal
but failed because of limited amount of time. 

* When doing Coding challenges: Focus on the following:

  * **Do medium and hard**, read easy problems and get an idea for them.

  * Summarize and then extend for each of the problem, about what we learn, how the problem can vary, make
  connection on the algorithmic level for to other similar problems.
    * Summarize the data structure, and the idea that got exploit for this problem. 
    * Time yourself when doing the coding challenges we have some ideas about the the speed of doing them. 

  * When stucked for too long, read more challenges and let that problem resolve at the back of your mind, if hours 
  after it's still not resolve, read the solution and understand it thoroughly, expand the solution, and make 
  connections to existing knowledges of CS on an algorithmc level.
