# Amzon Focus, Part II, CS Fundementals

## Techinical Online Assessment

* Yes, let's do this.

* Amazon allows for c++, C#, java, and python, I will focus on java 1.8 and python 3.7.

* Amzon allows and recommends that a partially working non-optimal solution for a solution that is trying to be optimal but failed because of limited amount of time.

* When doing Coding challenges: Focus on the following:

  * **Do medium and hard**, read easy problems and get an idea for them.

  * Summarize and then extend for each of the problem, about what we learn, how the problem can vary, make connections on the algorithmic level for to other similar problems.

	* Summarize the data structure, and the idea that got exploit for this problem.

	* Time yourself when doing the coding challenges we have some ideas about the the speed of doing them.

  * When stucked for too long, read more challenges and let that problem resolve at the back of your mind, if hours after it's still not resolve, read the solution and understand it thoroughly, expand the solution, and make
  connections to existing knowledges of CS on an algorithmc level.

## Work Style Assessment

* When doing the work style assessment, do it in a way that tightly follows the Amazon Leadership Principles, which is what they are actually testing on.
	* [Ledadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)
* Here is the summarization:
	* Customer Obsession:
	> Leaders in the company is obssessed about **customers**, they work hard to keep their trust.
	* Ownership
	> Don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results, they will incoperate need from different domain of the company.
	* Invent and simplify
	> Leaders require innovations and inventions from the team, and always find ways to simplify. Externally awared and look for new ideas.
	* Are right, Alot
	>  Leaders are right, they are right a lot.
	* Learn and Be Curious:
	> They never done with learning and always seek ti improve themselves, and curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
	* Hire and Develop the Best
	> They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly to move them throughout the organization, they develop leaders who take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
	* Insist on the Highest Standards
	> Standards are unreasonable high, they will continually raise the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality produces, services, and processes, problem are fixed and they stay fixed, and defects don't go down the line.
	* Think Big
	> Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results, they think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
	* Bias for Action
	> Speed matters, and decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study, We value **calculated risk taking**.
	* Frugality
	> Accomplish more with less
	* Earn Trust
	> Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, treat others respectfuly, vocally self-critical. They benchmark themselves against the best.
	* Dive Deep
	> Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.
	* Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
	> Leaders respectfually challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting, tenacious, and they don't compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
	* Deliver Results
	> Focus on the key inputs for their business, deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

### Something Important

  * **If made into the interview process and then get rejected, then there will be
  a year of freeze period before doing another interview at amazon.**
