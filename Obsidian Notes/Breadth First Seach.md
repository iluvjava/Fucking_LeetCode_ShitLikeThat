## BFS
* Using a queue to store the vertices

### BFS Exploited
* Path finding, even with multiple vertices. The depth labeling of verteices of the BFS tree is the same as the shortest path if the given graph has unweighted edges. [[Find Nearest Clone]]
* Depth of the tree also can do some kind of spreading simulations, see this problem: [[Rotting-Oranges]]
* BFS with multiple vertices is as simple as just initiate the queue with multiple vertices in it at the beginning. [[Rotting-Oranges]]
